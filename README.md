# This Is Ansel â€“ My Spotify Inspired Portfolio Site

This project is my simple, unfinished portfolio website that serves as a draft version. It's created with the primary goal of experimenting with different tech stacks and enhancing my front-end web development skills while showcasing creativity.

## Inspiration

The inspiration for "This Is Ansel" comes from my favourite music streaming platform, Spotify. The homepage of the site is influenced by the "This Is" playlists on Spotify. The project aims to capture the essence of Spotify's design, and its name reflects this influence.

The "About Me" page of the portfolio site draws inspiration from the artist pages found on Spotify. It includes sections for top songs (life timeline) and featured playlists (extracurriculars), providing visitors with an interactive and visually appealing way to learn more about me.

## Tech Stack

- Gatsby (Static Site Generator)
- Chakra UI (Styling and UI Component Management)
- Netlify (Deployment)

**Note:** Please be aware that the site is not yet fully compatible with mobile devices, and specific pages for work experiences are still under development.
